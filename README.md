# Fake-News-Detection-Using-NLP-And-ML

Libraries used : numpy , pandas , re , nltk , sklearn

In this project

I've developed a model to identify whether the given news is fake / real.

First i have explored the data ,

then did some preprocessing ( regular expression , removing stop words & lemmatization )

then used GridSearchCV to decide best parameter for each models

at last build a model to detect whether the given news is real / fake.
